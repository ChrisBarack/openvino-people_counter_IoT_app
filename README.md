# openvino-people_counter_IoT_app



The people counter application will demonstrate how to create a smart video IoT solution using Intel® hardware and software tools. The app will detect people in a designated area, providing the number of people in the frame, the average duration of people in the frame, and total count.

People counting applications can be used in a retail store, supermarket, shopping malls, metro station, airport. For example, Once a person is detected, We can follow the object through a shopping pipeline in a retail setting or track and collate behavior i.e customer traffic patterns and time spent at merchandising location.
